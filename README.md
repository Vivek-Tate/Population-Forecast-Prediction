### Population-Forecast-Prediction

## Description
This project aims to forecast the population of Haggis on a particular mountain. Ecologists have collected precise recordings of the population over five years and estimates from satellite remote sensing. The primary objective is to predict the true population 12 months into the future using various machine learning and time series analysis techniques.

## Methods and Technologies Used
### Data Collection and Validation
- Comparing precise recordings with satellite estimates.

### Time Series Analysis
- Identifying trends and patterns in historical data.

### Machine Learning Models
- Linear Regression
- ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)
- LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) Networks

### Evaluation Metrics
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)

### Technologies
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn


## Setup and Installation
1. Clone the repository:
